Common JS libraries for ResourceManager Experiment

This is JSON definitions for Free Libre Open Source commonly used JavaScript
libraries, and the JavaScript libraries that the JSON definitions refer to.

Linger on, your pale blue eyes.

This is for the experiment
[ResourceManager](https://github.com/AliceWonderMiscreations/ResourceManager)
that I am developing, in hopes of improving how third party resources are
handled by web applications.

Right now, only jQuery is here. And only most recent versions from the major
branches (1,2,3) and no UI variants.

This is experimental data.
