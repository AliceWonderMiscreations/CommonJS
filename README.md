Common JS libraries for ResourceManager Experiment

This is JSON definitions for Free Libre Open Source commonly used JavaScript
libraries, and the JavaScript libraries that the JSON definitions refer to.

Linger on, your pale blue eyes.

This is for the experimental JS/CSS Resource Manager I am developing.

Proof of Concept Implementation:

This repo contains various versions of jQuery with the corresponding JSON
configuration files that would be needed to implement the resource manager.

This repo is NOT intended as a source for jQuery.

In the hopeful even that this ResourceManager concept takes off, a "virtual"
vendor called "flossjs" would be created to contain the product "jquery"
amongst other products until such time that jQuery wanted to take of
distribution using this method themselves, when of course they would use
whatever vendor they wanted.

This repo presently is just experimental data for an experimental project.
